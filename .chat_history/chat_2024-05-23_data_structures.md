# Chat Session: Data Structures Documentation (2024-05-23)

## Summary

Created six comprehensive documentation files for data structures, designed for collaborative learning:

1. `01_arrays_and_lists.md` - Arrays and Lists implementation and exercises
2. `02_stacks.md` - Stack implementation with LIFO principles
3. `03_queues.md` - Queue implementations (standard, circular, priority)
4. `04_linked_lists.md` - Singly and doubly linked list implementations
5. `05_hash_tables.md` - Hash tables with collision resolution strategies
6. `06_trees.md` - Binary trees, traversals, and tree applications

## File Structure

Each file includes:

- Learning objectives
- Environment setup
- Concept visualization
- Starter code with gaps for team implementation
- Live coding collaboration tasks
- Peer discussion questions
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Common bugs and debugging tips
- Group challenge task

## Location

All files were placed in the `collab/ds/` directory.
