## 2048 Game

### Overview & Objective

The 2048 game is played on a 4x4 grid where the goal is to combine tiles with the same value to create a tile with the value of 2048.

Your objectives are:

1. Allow the user to play beyond 2048.
2. Enable grid size customization during initialization.
3. Allow setting the winning value during initialization.
4. Allow setting tile values to be powers of an arbitrary base.
5. Enable game restart after it ends.

### Game Rules

1. **Board Setup**: The game starts with one or more random tiles at random positions on a 4x4 board.
2. **Tile Values**: All tiles are powers of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ..., 2048).
3. **Possible Moves**: There are four possible moves: left, right, up, and down.
4. **Tile Movement**: Tiles slide in the direction of the move until stopped by another tile or the edge of the board.
5. **Merging Tiles**: If two tiles with the same value collide during a move, they merge into one tile with the combined value. Merged tiles do not merge again in the same move.
6. **New Tiles**: After each move, a new tile is randomly added to an empty spot on the board.
7. **Winning Condition**: The game is won when a tile with the value 2048 appears on the board.
8. **Losing Condition**: The game is lost if no moves are possible (no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same value).

### Command-Line Application Requirements

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start the game with two tiles numbered 2 at random positions.
   - Print the initial board state.
2. **User Moves**:
   - Allow users to enter a move (0 for left, 1 for right, 2 for up, 3 for down).
   - Slide tiles according to the move.
   - Add a new random tile.
   - Print the board state after each move.
3. **End Conditions**:
   - Print "Congratulations" if the game is won.
   - Print "Game over" if the game is lost.

### Code Snippets

#### Initializing the Board

```python
import random

def initialize_board():
    board = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(4)]
    add_random_tile(board)
    add_random_tile(board)
    return board

def add_random_tile(board):
    empty_tiles = [(i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if board[i][j] == 0]
    if empty_tiles:
        i, j = random.choice(empty_tiles)
        board[i][j] = 2

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(' '.join(str(tile) if tile != 0 else '-' for tile in row))
    print()

board = initialize_board()
print_board(board)
```

#### Making Moves

```python
def slide_left(board):
    for row in board:
        compress(row)
        merge(row)
        compress(row)

def compress(row):
    filtered_row = [tile for tile in row if tile != 0]
    missing_zeros = len(row) - len(filtered_row)
    return filtered_row + [0] * missing_zeros

def merge(row):
    for i in range(len(row) - 1):
        if row[i] == row[i + 1] and row[i] != 0:
            row[i] *= 2
            row[i + 1] = 0

def move(board, direction):
    if direction == 0:  # left
        for row in board:
            compress(row)
            merge(row)
            compress(row)
    elif direction == 1:  # right
        for row in board:
            row.reverse()
            compress(row)
            merge(row)
            compress(row)
            row.reverse()
    elif direction == 2:  # up
        for j in range(4):
            col = [board[i][j] for i in range(4)]
            compress(col)
            merge(col)
            compress(col)
            for i in range(4):
                board[i][j] = col[i]
    elif direction == 3:  # down
        for j in range(4):
            col = [board[i][j] for i in range(4)]
            col.reverse()
            compress(col)
            merge(col)
            compress(col)
            col.reverse()
            for i in range(4):
                board[i][j] = col[i]

    add_random_tile(board)

board = initialize_board()
print_board(board)

move(board, 1)  # Move right
print_board(board)

move(board, 3)  # Move down
print_board(board)
```

#### Checking Game Status

```python
def is_game_won(board):
    for row in board:
        if 2048 in row:
            return True
    return False

def is_game_over(board):
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(4):
            if board[i][j] == 0:
                return False
            if i < 3 and board[i][j] == board[i + 1][j]:
                return False
            if j < 3 and board[i][j] == board[i][j + 1]:
                return False
    return True

board = initialize_board()
while True:
    print_board(board)
    if is_game_won(board):
        print("Congratulations!")
        break
    if is_game_over(board):
        print("Game over!")
        break

    move_direction = int(input("Enter move (0: left, 1: right, 2: up, 3: down): "))
    move(board, move_direction)
```
