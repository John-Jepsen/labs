# Computer Vision Labs - Chat Session

## Project Overview

Created six comprehensive documentation files for computer vision labs, designed for collaborative learning:

1. **Image Loading and Manipulation** - Basic operations and color spaces
2. **Filtering and Convolution** - Applying kernels for image processing effects
3. **Edge Detection** - Sobel, Canny, and other edge detection techniques
4. **Contour Detection and Shapes** - Shape analysis and classification
5. **Face Detection** - Haar cascades and DNN-based face detection
6. **Image Segmentation** - Thresholding, clustering, and region-based segmentation

## Lab Structure

Each lab includes:

- Environmental setup instructions
- Visual concept explanations
- Starter code with TODO sections
- Group implementation tasks
- Peer review questions
- Troubleshooting guides
- Mini-project challenges

## Created Files

All files are stored in: `collab/computer_vision/`

```
01_image_loading_and_manipulation.md
02_filtering_and_convolution.md
03_edge_detection.md
04_contour_detection_and_shapes.md
05_face_detection.md
06_image_segmentation.md
```

## Implementation Approach

- Followed markdown style guidelines
- Structured for pair programming with clearly defined roles
- Included visual feedback opportunities throughout
- Incorporated both theoretical understanding and practical application
- Added real-world mini-projects at the end of each lab

## Next Steps

Consider adding:

- Sample images for the labs
- Example solutions folder
- Video tutorials to accompany the labs
- Assessment criteria for each mini-project
