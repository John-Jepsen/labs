# Documentation Request Template

## Project Type

Algorithm

## Documentation Goal

Create six standalone documentation files focused on active, collaborative learning of core search algorithms through hands-on coding and structured group work.

## Target Audience

Students, beginner developers, and coding bootcamp learners working in small groups or peer-learning environments.

## Technical Requirements

- Environment: Any OS with Python 3.8+
- Prerequisites: Intro-level programming and understanding of basic data structures (lists, sets, queues)
- Dependencies: Python standard library only

## Desired Sections (for each of the 6 files)

- Environment setup
- Visual explanation of the algorithm
- Pseudocode
- Annotated code template (incomplete)
- Live coding group activity
- Peer discussion prompts
- Time and space complexity walkthrough
- Common implementation mistakes
- Mini-challenge to reinforce learning

## Special Focus Areas

- Encourage students to compare and contrast algorithm performance
- Assign roles in group work (driver, navigator, explainer)
- Include checkpoints to test and reflect as a team
- Offer optional extensions for fast learners

## Code Examples Needed

Each file focuses on one algorithm:

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

   - Use queue
   - Apply to graph traversal

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

   - Use stack or recursion
   - Include graph and tree traversal examples

3. **Binary Search**

   - Iterative and recursive
   - Explain sorted array requirement

4. **Uniform Cost Search**

   - Use priority queue
   - Include cost-annotated graph

5. **A\* Search**

   - Combine heuristic with path cost
   - Apply to grid map navigation

6. **Iterative Deepening DFS**
   - Hybrid of DFS and BFS
   - Emphasize space/time benefits

## Additional Notes

Each file must:

- Be self-contained and runnable in under 2 minutes
- Include at least one pair programming activity
- Have a peer-review code prompt
- Include “checkpoint questions” to guide group reflection
