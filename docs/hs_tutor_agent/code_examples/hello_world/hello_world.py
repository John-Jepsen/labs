# This is your first Python program!
# Lines that start with # are comments - Python ignores them, but they help humans understand the code.

# This line displays a message on the screen
print("Hello, World!")

# Creating a variable to store your name
name = "Your Name"  # Change this to your actual name

# Displaying a personalized greeting using your name variable
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# You can add more print statements to display additional messages
print("Welcome to Python programming!")

# Creating a variable to store your age
age = 15  # Change this to your actual age

# Converting age to a string and displaying it
print("You are " + str(age) + " years old.")

# Using f-strings (a modern way to format strings in Python)
print(f"In 5 years, you'll be {age + 5} years old!")

# Try modifying any of the lines above or adding your own code below!
