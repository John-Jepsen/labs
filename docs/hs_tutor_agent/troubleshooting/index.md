# Troubleshooting

This section helps resolve common issues you might encounter when using the AI Tutor platform, whether you're a student, teacher, or developer.

## Common Issues

- [Setup Problems](beginner_setup.md): Issues installing required software
- [Connection Issues](connection_issues.md): Problems connecting to the AI tutor
- [Code Execution Errors](code_execution.md): Errors when running or testing code
- [AI Response Problems](ai_response_problems.md): Issues with AI tutor responses
- [Platform Access](platform_access.md): Login and account problems

## Quick Solutions for Students

### AI Tutor Not Responding

If the AI tutor stops responding or is giving generic responses:

1. Refresh the page
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try rephrasing your question
4. Restart your current lesson
5. Clear your browser cache

### Code Not Running

If your code fails to execute:

1. Check for syntax errors (missing parentheses, quotes, colons)
2. Verify all variables are defined before use
3. Check indentation (especially in Python)
4. Make sure you're using the correct file extension (.py for Python)
5. Try running a simple test (like `print("Hello")`) to verify the environment

### Can't Access Learning Content

If you can't access lessons or projects:

1. Verify you're logged in
2. Check if you've completed prerequisites
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try a different browser
5. Contact your teacher for access issues

If students can't access the platform:

1. Verify account creation and invitations
2. Check classroom enrollment settings
3. Reset student passwords if needed
4. Verify school network allows access

### Customization Problems

If curriculum customization isn't working:

1. Check permissions settings
2. Verify changes were saved
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check for conflicting changes

## Quick Solutions for Developers

### API Connection Issues

If having trouble connecting to the platform API:

1. Verify API key validity

3. Confirm request format
4. Look for CORS issues
5. Check rate limiting

### Environment Setup Problems

If development environment setup fails:

1. Verify prerequisites (Python, Node.js versions)
2. Check for missing dependencies
3. Confirm environment variables
4. Look for port conflicts
5. Check logs for detailed errors

### AI Agent Integration Issues

If AI agents aren't functioning correctly:

1. Verify API configurations
2. Check model availability
3. Test prompts directly with provider
4. Review conversation history format
5. Check for token limits

## Diagnosing Issues

### Platform Logs

Access logs to diagnose issues:

1. Student-level logs: Settings > Support > View Logs
2. Teacher admin logs: Admin Panel > Diagnostics > System Logs
3. Developer logs: Backend server logs in `/logs` directory

### Checking System Status

Verify if issues are local or system-wide:

1. Visit [status.aitutor.edu](https://status.aitutor.edu) (placeholder URL)
2. Check for announcements in the platform
3. Review system requirements to ensure compatibility

### Getting Support

If you can't resolve the issue:

1. **Students**: Contact your teacher or use the "Help" button in the platform
2. **Teachers**: Use the support portal in Admin > Support
3. **Developers**: Check GitHub issues or contact the development team
