## 1. Introduction to Integrals

### 1.1 The Antiderivative

An antiderivative of a function $f(x)$ is a function $F(x)$ such that $F'(x) = f(x)$. We denote the antiderivative as:

$$F(x) = \int f(x) \, dx$$

where $\int$ is the integral symbol and $dx$ indicates we're integrating with respect to $x$.

**Example:** If $f(x) = 2x$, then $F(x) = x^2 + C$ is an antiderivative since $\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + C) = 2x$.

### 1.2 Indefinite Integral

The indefinite integral of a function $f(x)$ represents the family of all antiderivatives of $f(x)$:

$$\int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C$$

where $C$ is an arbitrary constant of integration.

**Basic Integration Rules:**

- $\int k \, dx = kx + C$ (where $k$ is a constant)
- $\int x^n \, dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C$ (where $n \neq -1$)
- $\int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C$
- $\int e^x \, dx = e^x + C$
- $\int \sin x \, dx = -\cos x + C$
- $\int \cos x \, dx = \sin x + C$

### 1.3 Definite Integral

The definite integral of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$ is defined as:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)$$

where $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

**Geometric Interpretation:** The definite integral represents the signed area between the function $f(x)$ and the x-axis from $x = a$ to $x = b$.

**Properties of Definite Integrals:**

- $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = -\int_{b}^{a} f(x) \, dx$
- $\int_{a}^{b} [f(x) \pm g(x)] \, dx = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \pm \int_{a}^{b} g(x) \, dx$
- $\int_{a}^{b} kf(x) \, dx = k\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$ (where $k$ is a constant)
- $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = \int_{a}^{c} f(x) \, dx + \int_{c}^{b} f(x) \, dx$ (for any $c$ between $a$ and $b$)

## 2. Techniques of Integration

### 2.1 Substitution Method

The substitution method (or u-substitution) involves transforming the integral by substituting a new variable.

If $u = g(x)$, then $du = g'(x) \, dx$, and:

$$\int f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du$$

**Example:** To evaluate $\int 2x \cos(x^2) \, dx$:

- Let $u = x^2$, so $du = 2x \, dx$
- This transforms the integral to $\int \cos(u) \, du = \sin(u) + C = \sin(x^2) + C$

### 2.2 Integration by Parts

The integration by parts formula is derived from the product rule of differentiation:

$$\int u(x)v'(x) \, dx = u(x)v(x) - \int v(x)u'(x) \, dx$$

or in simplified notation:

$$\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du$$

This is particularly useful for integrals involving products of functions.

**Example:** To calculate $\int x\cos(x) \, dx$:

- Let $u = x$ and $dv = \cos(x) \, dx$
- Then $du = dx$ and $v = \sin(x)$
- Applying the formula: $\int x\cos(x) \, dx = x\sin(x) - \int \sin(x) \, dx = x\sin(x) + \cos(x) + C$

### 2.3 Partial Fractions

For rational functions (quotients of polynomials), the method of partial fractions decomposes the integrand into simpler fractions that are easier to integrate.

**Example:** For $\int \frac{1}{x^2-1} \, dx$:

- Decompose into $\int \frac{1}{x^2-1} \, dx = \int \frac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)} \, dx = \int \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{B}{x+1} \, dx$
- Solving for $A$ and $B$ gives $A = \frac{1}{2}$ and $B = -\frac{1}{2}$
- The integral becomes $\int \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{x-1} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{x+1} \, dx = \frac{1}{2} \ln|x-1| - \frac{1}{2} \ln|x+1| + C = \frac{1}{2} \ln|\frac{x-1}{x+1}| + C$

---

## 3. Numerical Integration

### 3.1 Riemann Sums

A Riemann sum approximates the definite integral by dividing the interval $[a,b]$ into $n$ subintervals and summing the areas of simpler shapes (usually rectangles).

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x$$

where $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ and $x_i^*$ is a point in the $i$-th subinterval.

**Types of Riemann Sums:**

- **Left Riemann Sum:** $x_i^* = a + (i-1)\Delta x$
- **Right Riemann Sum:** $x_i^* = a + i\Delta x$
- **Midpoint Riemann Sum:** $x_i^* = a + (i-\frac{1}{2})\Delta x$

### 3.2 Trapezoidal Rule

The trapezoidal rule approximates the integral using trapezoids instead of rectangles:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{\Delta x}{2} \left[ f(a) + 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} f(a + i\Delta x) + f(b) \right]$$

### 3.3 Simpson's Rule

Simpson's rule approximates the integral by fitting parabolas through sets of three points:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{\Delta x}{3} \left[ f(a) + 4\sum_{i=1}^{n/2} f(a + (2i-1)\Delta x) + 2\sum_{i=1}^{n/2-1} f(a + 2i\Delta x) + f(b) \right]$$

where $n$ is an even number.

## 4. Improper Integrals

### 4.1 Infinite Limits

An improper integral with infinite limits is defined as:

$$\int_{a}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{a}^{t} f(x) \, dx$$

$$\int_{-\infty}^{b} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{t \to -\infty} \int_{t}^{b} f(x) \, dx$$

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx = \int_{-\infty}^{c} f(x) \, dx + \int_{c}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx$$

where $c$ is any real number.

### 4.2 Discontinuous Integrands

For a function with a discontinuity at a point $c$ in $[a,b]$:

$$\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} \left[ \int_{a}^{c-\epsilon} f(x) \, dx + \int_{c+\epsilon}^{b} f(x) \, dx \right]$$

---

## 5. Multiple Integrals

### 5.1 Double Integrals

A double integral over a region $R$ in the xy-plane is written as:

$$\iint_R f(x,y) \, dA = \iint_R f(x,y) \, dx \, dy$$

For a rectangular region $R = [a,b] \times [c,d]$:

$$\iint_R f(x,y) \, dA = \int_{a}^{b} \int_{c}^{d} f(x,y) \, dy \, dx = \int_{c}^{d} \int_{a}^{b} f(x,y) \, dx \, dy$$

**Geometric Interpretation:** The double integral represents the volume under the surface $z = f(x,y)$ over the region $R$.

### 5.2 Triple Integrals

Triple integrals extend to three dimensions and are written as:

$$\iiint_V f(x,y,z) \, dV = \iiint_V f(x,y,z) \, dx \, dy \, dz$$

## 6. Line and Surface Integrals

### 6.1 Line Integrals

A line integral of a function $f(x,y)$ along a curve $C$ is given by:

$$\int_C f(x,y) \, ds$$

If $C$ is parameterized by $\vec{r}(t) = (x(t), y(t))$ for $t \in [a,b]$, then:

$$\int_C f(x,y) \, ds = \int_{a}^{b} f(x(t), y(t)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt$$

### 6.2 Surface Integrals

A surface integral of a function $f(x,y,z)$ over a surface $S$ is written as:

$$\iint_S f(x,y,z) \, dS$$

## 7. Applications in Machine Learning

### 7.1 Expectation and Probability Density Functions

In probability theory and machine learning, integrals are used to calculate the expected value of a continuous random variable $X$ with probability density function $f(x)$:

$$E[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) \, dx$$

Similarly, the variance is calculated as:

$$Var[X] = E[(X-E[X])^2] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x-E[X])^2 f(x) \, dx$$

### 7.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation

In maximum likelihood estimation, we often need to maximize the log-likelihood function, which can involve integrals for continuous distributions.

### 7.3 Bayesian Inference

In Bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:

$$p(\theta|D) \propto p(D|\theta)p(\theta)$$

Normalizing this distribution often requires computing integrals:

$$p(\theta|D) = \frac{p(D|\theta)p(\theta)}{\int p(D|\theta)p(\theta) \, d\theta}$$

### 7.4 Neural Networks and Backpropagation

The training of neural networks involves minimizing a loss function, which can be seen as finding the parameters that minimize an integral over the training data.

### 7.5 Information Theory

The entropy of a continuous random variable with probability density function $f(x)$ is:

$$H(X) = -\int f(x) \log f(x) \, dx$$

This is fundamental in information theory and machine learning for measuring uncertainty.

### 7.6 Monte Carlo Methods

Monte Carlo methods approximate integrals using random sampling:

$$\int f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(X_i)$$

where $X_i$ are random samples. This is crucial in high-dimensional problems where traditional numerical integration becomes computationally intractable.

## 8. Practical Examples and Exercises

### Example 1: Calculating Probabilities

Calculate the probability that a random variable following a standard normal distribution lies between -1 and 1:

$$P(-1 \leq X \leq 1) = \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}} \, dx \approx 0.6827$$

### Example 2: Expected Value Calculation

For a random variable with probability density function $f(x) = 2x$ for $0 \leq x \leq 1$ and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, calculate the expected value:

$$E[X] = \int_{0}^{1} x \cdot 2x \, dx = \int_{0}^{1} 2x^2 \, dx = 2 \cdot \frac{x^3}{3} \big|_{0}^{1} = \frac{2}{3}$$

### Example 3: Computing a Double Integral

Evaluate the double integral $\iint_R xy \, dA$ where $R = [0,1] \times [0,2]$:

$$\iint_R xy \, dA = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{2} xy \, dy \, dx = \int_{0}^{1} x \left[ \frac{y^2}{2} \right]_{0}^{2} \, dx = \int_{0}^{1} 2x \, dx = \left[ x^2 \right]_{0}^{1} = 1$$
