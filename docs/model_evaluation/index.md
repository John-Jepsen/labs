# Model Evaluation

This section provides comprehensive resources for evaluating machine learning models. Understanding how to properly evaluate models is essential for developing effective machine learning solutions.

## Overview

Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well your machine learning models perform. This involves using various metrics and techniques to measure prediction accuracy, generalization capability, and other performance aspects.

## Key Topics

- **Classification Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curves, and AUC
- **Regression Metrics**: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared, and adjusted R-squared
- **Validation Techniques**: Train-test splits, cross-validation, and stratified sampling
- **Overfitting Detection**: Learning curves, validation curves, and regularization
- **Model Comparison**: Statistical tests and confidence intervals
