# C Programming Standards

## Code Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation, not tabs
- Maximum line length of 80 characters
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Place opening braces on the same line as control statements
- Always use braces for control statements, even single-line blocks

## Memory Management
- Always check return values from memory allocation functions
- Free all allocated memory before function return
- Use appropriate error handling for memory allocation failures
- Check for NULL pointers before dereferencing

## Debugging
- Use descriptive variable names to aid debugging
- Add helpful comments for complex logic
- For GDB/LLDB usage, compile with `-g` flag for debug symbols
