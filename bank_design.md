**Topic: Online Bank Design**

**Task:**
You have been tasked with creating a new online bank. Your assignment is to create a flowchart outlining how you would implement this project. The flowchart should cover the main aspects of the bank's operations and customer interactions.

**Requirements:**

**1. User Roles and Permissions:**

- **Employee Accounts:**
  - Define roles for customer service representatives, managers, and IT staff.
  - Record all activities performed by employees on customer accounts (e.g., viewing account details, making changes).

**2. Customer Account Features:**

- **Account Management:**
  - Customers can create and manage checking and savings accounts.
  - Allow instant transfers between checking and savings accounts.
  - Include features for viewing transaction history, setting up recurring transfers, and receiving notifications.

**3. External Interactions:**

- **Bill Pay:**
  - Customers can set up bill pay to manage and pay external bank accounts.
  - Support recurring payments, payment tracking, and notifications.
- **One-off Check Creation:**
  - Basic functionality to issue checks when required.

**Additional Feature:**

- **Brokerage Account Integration:**
  - If you finish the main task early, outline how you would add the ability for customers to have brokerage accounts for buying and selling stocks.

**Tools:**
You can use any design software you prefer to map out this app. [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) is a recommended choice if you're unsure where to start.

**Deliverables:**

1. **Flowchart** - A simple flowchart detailing the structure and flow of the online bank, including:

   - User account management (employees and customers)
   - Customer account operations (checking and savings accounts)
   - External payment interactions (bill pay and check creation)
   - Brokerage account integration (if applicable)

2. **Documentation** - A brief explanation of each section of the flowchart.
