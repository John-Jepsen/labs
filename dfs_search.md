### Algorithm: Depth-First Search (DFS)

Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Algoria, Sir Cedric, a noble knight, embarked on a quest to rescue Princess Elara from the Tower of Mazes. His trusted dragon, Ember, flew them swiftly over the treacherous landscape. The Tower of Mazes, a formidable labyrinth, required a clever strategy to navigate.

#### Initialize Data Structures:

- Sir Cedric used a magical map (stack) to keep track of the paths he needed to explore.
- He carried a magical lantern (set) to remember the paths he had already traveled.

#### Traverse the Labyrinth:

- Sir Cedric started at the entrance, marking it with the lantern's light.
- He delved into the labyrinth, moving from one chamber (node) to the next, always choosing the deepest path first.

#### Repeat:

- Whenever he reached a dead end, he retraced his steps to the last junction and chose a new path.

#### Implementation:

```py
def dfs(maze: Dict[int, List[int]], start: int) -> List[int]:
    def explore(chamber):
        lantern.add(chamber)
        for passage in maze[chamber]:
            if passage not in lantern:
                explore(passage)
        path.append(chamber)

    lantern = set()
    path = []

    for chamber in maze:
        if chamber not in lantern:
            explore(chamber)

    return path[::-1]

# Example usage:
maze = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [4, 5],
    3: [6, 7],
    4: [],
    5: [],
    6: [],
    7: []
}
start = 1
print(dfs(maze, start))  # Output: Path through the labyrinth
```

#### Explanation:

Initialize:

- `lantern`: A magical set that marks the paths explored.
- `path`: The sequence of chambers explored, marking Sir Cedric's journey.

Traverse the Labyrinth:

- Sir Cedric delved into the maze, marking chambers and exploring passages.

Repeat:

- He backtracked to the last junction whenever he reached a dead end, ensuring he explored every path.
