   - Provide clear expectations and requirements

3. **Submit the filled template** to generate documentation

## Expected Output Structure

The generated documentation will follow this structure:

- **Bold Title as H1** at the top
- Clear **Objective** section explaining purpose
- Key Goals listed as bullet points
- Step-by-step instructions organized as numbered stages
- Code blocks for commands and implementations
- Well-formatted tables for structured data
- Best practices and troubleshooting sections
- Conclusion with next steps

## Guidelines Followed

The output will adhere to these principles:

1. **Clear Document Structure**

   - Proper heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections)
   - Consistent formatting throughout
   - Logical progression of information

2. **Technical Depth**

   - Match complexity to target audience
   - Balance theory and practical implementation
   - Define technical terms and concepts

3. **Code Quality**

   - Clear comments and explanations
   - Consistent formatting and style

4. **Visual Elements**
   - Tables for comparing options
   - Command formatting in blocks
   - References to diagrams where appropriate

## Example Usage

For a project requiring vector database integration documentation:

1. Use the `vector_db_example.md` as is or modify as needed
2. Submit to generate a comprehensive guide
3. The output will match the style of our "API & Vector Database Setup" reference document
